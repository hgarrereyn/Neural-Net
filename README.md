# Neural-Net
A small Java library to run and train neural networks using backpropagation and genetic algorithms.

Examples are provided in green.neural.net.main.

# Using neural net
Packages needed:
- green.neural.net

Documentation is provided in the files.

# Using the genetic evolution simulator
*Working but still under development and no documentation*

Packages needed:
- green.neural.net
- green.neural.net.ga

Libraries needed:
- [Jbox2d](https://github.com/jbox2d/jbox2d)

# Using the backpropagation algorithms
*A little broken and under development*

Packages needed:
- green.neural.net
- green.neural.net.bp

Run NetTrainer.java to see a 2-3-1 neural network trained to become an XOR gate.
